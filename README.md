Can you at least see me once and let me apologize in person? 😭 I was also shocked, I didn’t expect things to turn out like that… 😭 So I want to explain it to you 😭 If I knew, I would have stopped them, but they suddenly started playing when the schedule was over 😭 I couldn’t stop everyone, I’m really sorry… 😭 Sakichan, you’re angry, aren’t you… 😭 I think you have every right to be angry 😭 But please believe me. Haruhikage, it wasn’t in our planned repertoire 😭 I’m really sorry 😭 I promise you I won’t play it randomly again 😭 I’ll make sure they never play this song again 😭 Can we talk a little bit? 😭 I really value everything about CRYCHIC 😭 So, when they played Haruhikage without permission, I was as sad as you 😭 I hope you can understand my feelings 😭 Please. I’ll go anywhere 😭 I’ll also explain to you why I had to form a band 😭 I think if you can see me, you’ll understand 😭 I’m your companion, Sakichan 😭 I really want to see you 😭
